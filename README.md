## Usage

To use the service, you could use the swagger documentation, see [API Documentation](#api-documentation), or
any other http client.

## API Documentation

We use [openapi:json] standard for API. We use swagger for documenting our API.

To open online documentation, go to [swagger editor], here is how you can start it
```bash
  cd docs
  npm install
  npm start
```
To build documentation use `npm run build` command,
that will create open-api documentation in `web_deploy` folder.

To generate resources for Go models run `./generate.sh` script in root folder.
use `./generate.sh --help` to see all available options.
